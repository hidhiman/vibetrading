"""Allowlist registry for internal scheduled callables (scheduler unification).

The ONLY name→callable mapping available to ``executor_kind == "internal"``
jobs. Security contract — this is the safety bedrock, "no arbitrary shell,
no dynamic import":

* Keys are literal strings registered in THIS module. The production surface
  is the explicit ``_INTERNAL_CALLABLES`` dict at the bottom, populated by
  module edit only. Nothing in a request path (HTTP body, job file free
  text, environment variable) may ever register a callable;
  :func:`register_internal` exists for module edits and tests.
* Resolution is an exact-key dict lookup. There is NO dynamic resolution of
  any kind: names are never parsed as import paths, never turned into code,
  and never walked through attribute chains. A name that happens to be a
  real import path (a stdlib process-spawning function, say) resolves to
  nothing unless that exact string is a registered key — the registry's
  name space and Python's import space are fully isolated.
* Malformed names are rejected before any lookup: the shape allowlist
  (dotted identifiers only) fails every separator, ``..``, whitespace and
  shell-metacharacter form by construction.
* Values are callables taking no required arguments, sync or async. The run
  contract lives on the executor side (see
  :mod:`src.scheduled_research.internal_dispatch`): sync callables are
  offloaded through ``asyncio.to_thread``, async callables are awaited
  directly, always in a background task — never on the serialized tick loop.
* Domain imports are DEFERRED: each production entry is a literal zero-arg
  wrapper whose body imports the domain callable at first firing. This
  module is imported by the generic :mod:`src.scheduling` package (and,
  through it, by ``scheduled_research.models``), so a top-level domain
  import here would drag the whole ``br_data``/``memory`` stack into every
  process that merely touches the scheduling vocabulary — and invert the
  dependency direction of the generic kernel. The wrappers keep the dict
  literal-keyed and exact-match-only; the deferred import is a fixed module
  statement inside a function body, never a name-driven resolution.
